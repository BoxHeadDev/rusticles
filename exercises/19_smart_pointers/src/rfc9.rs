// ðŸ¦€ Rustlings Challenge: Rc<T> and Weak<T> Reference Counting
//
// In this challenge, you'll explore how strong and weak counts behave
// when using `Rc<T>` and `Weak<T>` together with interior mutability.
//
// Tasks:
// 1. Use `Rc::downgrade` to create a weak reference from `leaf.parent` to `branch`.
// 2. Print `strong_count` and `weak_count` to observe how they change over time.
// 3. After the scope ends, check that the weak pointer was dropped automatically.
//
// Expected behavior:
// - leaf starts with strong = 1, weak = 0
// - branch adds another strong to leaf and gets a weak from leaf
// - after branch goes out of scope, parent is dropped, and weak can't be upgraded
