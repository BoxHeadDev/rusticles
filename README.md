# Rusticles 🦀 🧠

Rusticles is a personal learning project inspired by [Rustlings](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/), designed to help reinforce your Rust knowledge through custom exercises and spaced repetition.

While Rustlings provides a solid introduction to Rust concepts, Rusticles extends this by adding new challenges and integrating a system that helps you retain what you've learned using spaced repetition techniques. Think of it as a code kata meets flashcards – tailored for your Rust journey.
