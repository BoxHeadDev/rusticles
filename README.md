# Rust Exercises

Welcome to the **Rust Exercises** repository! 🎉

This project is a collection of coding challenges derived from code examples in various programming resources as I learn Rust. The goal is to solidify my understanding of Rust while creating engaging and educational challenges for others to enjoy.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- **Learn Rust**: Enhance my understanding of Rust by translating and adapting code examples from books.
- **Create Challenges**: Turn code examples into fun and thought-provoking challenges for others to solve.
- **Share Knowledge**: Build a resource for others who are learning Rust and looking for coding practice.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
.
├── exercises/
|   └── 01-Topic              # Exerises are split by topic
│       ├── challenge-01/     # First challenge with its problem statement
│       ├── challenge-02/     # Second challenge, and so on...
│       └── ...
├── solutions/                # My solutions to the challenges
└── README.md                 # You're here!
```

### Exercise Structure

Each challenge folder typically includes:

- `starter_code.rs`: A file containing all exersies related to topic.
- `fn exercise_1(){}`: A function scaffold for your solution.
- `comment`: A comment above the function to guide you.
