// ü¶Ä Rustlings Challenge: Moving Data into Threads
//
// Spawning threads often requires `move` closures to transfer data
// safely from the main thread into the new thread's environment.
//
// Tasks:
// 1. Fix the compiler error by moving `v` into the spawned thread.
// 2. Understand why `drop(v)` is no longer valid after the move.
//
// HINTS:
// - Use the `move` keyword to move ownership of `v`.
// - After moving `v`, it is no longer available in the main thread.
//
// Uncomment each section below step-by-step to test your understanding.

use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    // ‚úÖ Use `move` to transfer ownership of `v` into the thread
    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        println!("Here's a vector: {v:?}");
    });

    // ‚ùå Can't drop `v` here: it was moved to the thread closure above
    // drop(v); // Uncommenting this line will cause a compile error: use of moved value

    handle.join().unwrap();
}
