// Solution: Use a boolean expression for the `if` condition
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number == 3 {
        // Compare `number` to 3 to create a boolean condition
        println!("number was three");
    }
}
// Context: In Rust, the condition in an if statement must be a boolean expression (true or false). Unlike some other languages, you cannot use non-boolean values (like integers) as conditions.
