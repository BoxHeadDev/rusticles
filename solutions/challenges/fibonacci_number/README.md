# Fibonacci Number Generator Challenge
 

## Key Features

- Three different approaches:
  1. Iterative approach - O(n) time complexity, best for large values of n.
  2. Recursive approach - O(2‚Åø) time complexity, inefficient for large n.
  3. Memoized recursive approach - O(n) time complexity, avoids redundant calculations.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.
- Allows the user to exit by typing "exit".
- Measures execution time for all three approaches.
