// Define a unit-like struct called `AlwaysEqual`.
struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main() {
    // Create an instance of AlwaysEqual.
    let subject = AlwaysEqual;
}
// Context: Unit-like structs in Rust are structs without any fields. They are often used for specific purposes, such as marker types or when the struct itself conveys meaning without needing data.
