// Solution: The code is fixed by correctly downgrading the mutable reference to an immutable one.
fn main() {
    let mut v: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let num: &mut i32 = &mut v[2]; // Mutable reference to the third element.
    let num2: &i32 = &*num; // Downgrade the mutable reference to an immutable one for read-only access.
    println!("{} {}", *num, *num2); // Print both the mutable and downgraded immutable references.
}
// Context: downgrading mutable references in Rust allows you to temporarily create an immutable reference from a mutable reference for read-only purposes, as long as no conflicting mutable operations are performed during its usage.
