// Solution: The type `fsize` does not exist in Rust. Floats must be either `f32` or `f64`.
fn main() {
    let x: f32 = 2.0; // Correctly specify `f32` as the floating-point type.
    println!("{x}");
}
// Context: Rust supports two floating-point types: f32 and f64. These represent 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point numbers, respectively. If you attempt to use an unsupported type like fsize, the compiler will throw an error, as it doesnâ€™t exist.
