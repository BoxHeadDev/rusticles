// Solution: Call `another_function` from within `main`
fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
// Context: Functions in Rust are an essential way to organize and reuse code. In this exercise, you'll call a function from within the main function.

fn main() {
    // Execute the function to see if your changes worked!

    another_function();
}
