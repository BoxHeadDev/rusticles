// Solution: The code is fixed by ensuring the reference `y` is no longer used after `x` is modified.
fn main() {
    let mut x = 1;
    let y = &x; // Start of the immutable borrow.
    let z = *y; // Dereference `y` to get the value of `x`.
    // `y` is no longer used after this point.
    x += z; // Safe to modify `x` now because the borrow has ended.
}
// Context: References in Rust are valid only within their appropriate scope.
