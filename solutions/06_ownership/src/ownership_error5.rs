// Solution: The code is fixed by using the mutable reference properly and avoiding invalid references.
fn main() {
    let mut n = 0;
    let a = &mut n; // Create a mutable reference to `n`.
    // If `b` needs to be used, we can reassign the reference from `a`.
    let b = a; // `a` is now invalid, but `b` owns the mutable reference.
    *b += 1; // Use `b` to modify `n`.
    println!("{}", b); // Safely use `b`.
}
// Context: Rust enforces a strict rule: there can only be one mutable reference to a variable at a time. In the original code, a is a mutable reference to n, and then b is assigned to a. While this does not create a second mutable reference, it transfers ownership of the mutable reference, leaving a invalid.
