// Solution:
fn main() {
    // Solution 1:
    let b = Box::new(0); // Create a new Box containing 0.
    move_a_box4(b); // Transfer ownership of `b` to the function.
    // No attempt to use `b` here, as it is no longer valid.

    // Solution 2: Clone b Before Transferring Ownership
    let b = Box::new(0); // Create a new Box containing 0.
    let b_clone = b.clone(); // Clone the Box to preserve the original value.
    move_a_box4(b); // Transfer ownership of the original `b` to the function.
    println!("{}", b_clone); // Safely use the cloned Box.

    // Solution 3: Reassign Ownership to a New Variable
    let b = Box::new(0); // Create a new Box containing 0.
    let b2 = b; // Move ownership of `b` to `b2`.
    move_a_box4(b2); // Transfer ownership of `b2` to the function.
    // `b` is not used here, as ownership has been moved.
}

fn move_a_box4(b: Box<i32>) {
    println!("Moved value: {}", b); // Ownership of the Box is taken here.
}
// Context: The original code transfers ownership of a Box from b to the move_a_box function, then attempts to use b afterward. This is not allowed because b is no longer valid after its ownership has been moved.
