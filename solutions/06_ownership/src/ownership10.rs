// Solution:
fn main() {
    // Solution 1: Use a New Variable Instead of b2
    let b = Box::new(0); // Create a new Box containing 0.
    let b2 = b.clone(); // Clone the Box to preserve the original value in `b`.
    move_a_box3(b2); // Transfer ownership of the cloned Box to the function.
    println!("Original Box value: {}", b); // Safely use `b` since it wasnâ€™t moved.

    // Solution 2: Avoid Reassigning Ownership to b2let b = Box::new(0); // Create a new Box containing 0.
    move_a_box3(b); // Transfer ownership of `b` to the function.
    // `b` is no longer valid here, so no need to assign it to `b2`.

    // Solution 3: Reassign Ownership Without Calling move_a_box Directly
    let b = Box::new(0); // Create a new Box containing 0.
    let b2 = b; // Reassign ownership of `b` to `b2`.
    println!("Reassigned Box value: {}", b2); // Safely use `b2`.
    move_a_box3(b2); // Now transfer ownership of `b2` to the function.
}

fn move_a_box3(b: Box<i32>) {
    println!("Moved value: {}", b); // Ownership of the Box is taken here.
}
// Context: The original code transfers ownership of a Box from b to the move_a_box function, then attempts to use b again to assign it to b2. This is not allowed because b is no longer valid after its ownership has been moved.
