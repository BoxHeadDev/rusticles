// Solution: The code is fixed by ensuring all mutable operations are scoped correctly.
fn main() {
    let mut point = [0, 1];
    let mut x = point[0]; // Copy the value of `point[0]` into `x`.
    {
        let y = &mut point[1]; // Borrow `point[1]` mutably within its own scope.
        *y += 1; // Safely modify `point[1]`.
    }
    x += 1; // Modify the independent variable `x`.
    println!("{} {}", point[0], point[1]); // Safely access and print the elements of the array.
}
// Context: The original code attempts to create a mutable reference to point[1] (y) while modifying a copy of point[0] (x). Although x does not directly interact with point, Rust enforces strict borrowing rules that prevent this.
