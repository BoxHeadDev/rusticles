// Solution: The code is already valid, but redundant slicing operations can be removed for clarity.
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello"); // Create a string.

    // Reference part of the string.
    let slice = &s[3..]; // Slice from index 3 to the end of the string.

    // Reference the whole string.
    let slice = &s[..]; // Slice the entire string.
}
// Context: The code demonstrates how to create slices of a String for referencing parts or the whole string.
