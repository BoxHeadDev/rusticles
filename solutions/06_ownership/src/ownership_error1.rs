// Solution: The code is fixed by returning the `String` itself, transferring ownership.
fn return_a_string() -> String {
    let s = String::from("Hello world"); // Create a new `String`.
    s // Return the `String` itself, transferring ownership to the caller.
}

fn main() {
    // Execute the function to see if your changes worked!
    let result = return_a_string();
    println!("{}", result);
}

// Context: The code attempted to return a reference to a local variable, but local variables are deallocated when the function ends. Returning a reference to such data would result in a dangling reference.
