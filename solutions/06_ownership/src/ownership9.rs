// Solution:
fn main() {
    // Solution 1: Use Only b2 After Ownership Transfer
    let b = Box::new(0); // Create a new Box containing 0.
    let b2 = b; // Ownership of the Box is moved to `b2`.
    println!("{}", b2); // Use `b2`, which now owns the Box.
    move_a_box2(b2); // Transfer ownership of `b2` to the function.

    // Solution 2: Avoid Transferring Ownership to b2
    let b = Box::new(0); // Create a new Box containing 0.
    println!("{}", b); // Use `b` before transferring ownership.
    move_a_box2(b); // Transfer ownership of `b` directly to the function.

    // Solution 3: Clone the Box if You Need Both b and b2
    let b = Box::new(0); // Create a new Box containing 0.
    let b2 = b.clone(); // Clone the Box to preserve the original value in `b`.
    println!("{}", b); // Use the original Box.
    move_a_box2(b2); // Transfer ownership of the cloned Box to the function.
}

fn move_a_box2(b: Box<i32>) {
    println!("Moved value: {}", b); // Ownership of the Box is taken here.
}
// Context: The original code transfers ownership of a Box from b to b2, but it attempts to use b afterward. This is not allowed in Rust because b is no longer valid after the ownership is moved to b2.
