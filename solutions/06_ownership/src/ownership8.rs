// Solution:
fn main() {
    // Solution 1: Use Only b2 After Ownership Transfer
    let b = Box::new(0); // Create a new Box containing 0.
    let b2 = b; // Ownership of the Box is moved to `b2`.
    move_a_box(b2); // Use `b2` to transfer ownership.

    // Solution 2: Avoid Transferring Ownership to b2
    let b = Box::new(0); // Create a new Box containing 0.
    move_a_box(b); // Transfer ownership of `b` directly without using `b2`.

    // Solution 3: Clone the Box to Keep Ownership
    let b = Box::new(0); // Create a new Box containing 0.
    let b2 = b.clone(); // Clone the Box to keep both `b` and `b2` valid.
    move_a_box(b); // Transfer ownership of `b` to the function.
    println!("Still have b2: {}", b2); // Use the cloned Box.
}

fn move_a_box(b: Box<i32>) {
    println!("Moved value: {}", b); // Ownership of the Box is taken here.
}
// Context: The original code transfers ownership of a Box value to two places: first to b2 and then to the move_a_box function. After ownership is moved, the original variable (b) is no longer valid. Rust enforces these rules to prevent undefined behaviour, such as double-free errors.
