// Solution: The code is fixed by avoiding an ownership transfer from the reference.
fn main() {
    let v: Vec<String> = vec![String::from("Hello world")];
    let s_ref: &String = &v[0]; // Immutable reference to the first element of the vector.
    // Use the reference directly or clone the string if ownership is needed.
    let s: String = s_ref.clone(); // Clone the string to create a new owned `String`.
    println!("{}", s); // Safely use the new owned `String`.
}
// Context: The original code attempts to create a String by dereferencing an immutable reference (s_ref). This would lead to an ownership conflict and potentially a double free because v is still responsible for the ownership of the string.
